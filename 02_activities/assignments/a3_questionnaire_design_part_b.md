# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    Yes, we expect the sample to be representative of our target population because we are using a stratified sampling method for all eligble voters.
    Our target population was all eligible voters across Canada, and by using stratified sampling, we are expecting the samples to be divided into the defined strata groups (Region, Age Group, and Income Level).
    This will provide us with high quality samples and help ensure reliable insights into our voter's preferences and priorities.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    For my survey in Q4, I would change "your interests" to "your priorities" to avoid leading language.
        4. Does our political parties policy agenda support your interests?
            Changed to:
                4. Does our political parties policy agenda support your priorities?

    
    For Q5 and Q6, I would combine them into a single question to prioritize their concerns and increase efficiency. By decreasing the survey length, I would help decrease respondent burden.
        5. Which issue do you feel our political party addresses well?
        Economy
        Healthcare
        Education
        Housing
        6. Which issue do you feel our political party addresses poorly?
        Economy
        Healthcare
        Education     
        Housing    
            Changed to:    
                5. What are the top three issues you would like us to focus on?
                    - Economy
                    - Healthcare
                    - Climate Change
                    - Education
                    - Housing
                    - Other: ________
                        
    I would also add an open-ended follow up question to provide qualitative insights into our voter's priorities and suggestions.
        "If you could improve one thing about our political party, what would it be?"
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, the purpose of our survey could NOT have been fulfilled through an observaitonal study. 
    This is due to the survey being able to gather opinions and preferences from our voters directly through questions. 
    Having a structure method of obtaining subjective data directly, allows us to understand the voters' opinions and create insights.
    An observational study would NOT be able to provide insights into the voters' preferences or opinions because observational studies are focused on observing patterns and trends.
    ```

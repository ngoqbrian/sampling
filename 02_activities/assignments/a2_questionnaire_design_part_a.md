# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: 2 - Canadian Federal Election

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of our survey is to understand the voter's priorities, concerns, and expectations from our political party and its leader. 
This will allow us to refine our campaign strategy and target specific voter groups in order to maintain our lead and win the election. 
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: Eligible voters across Canada for the federal election

Sampling Frame: List of registered voters

Sampling Units: Individual voters - each voter from the list of registered voters

Observational Units: Individual voters - each voter when they provide a survey response

In this scenario, the sampling and observation units are the same. 
The key difference in other cases is that sampling units are part of the selection process (selected from the sampling frame), while observation units are part of the measurement process (which the data is gathered directly from).
```
